This repository is about the the Decision tree computation on jupyter notebook which was done in class and the animal classification classification assignment.
**Decision Trees in machine learning:**
In machine learning, decision trees are a common supervised learning technique used to model
and predict outcomes based on input data. The structure resembles a tree, with each internal node testing 
an attribute, each branch denoting an attribute value, and each leaf node representing the conclusion or forecast.

**Decision tree in the animal classification data**:
The decision tree in animal classification data is used to classify animals into mammals and non mammals using several features.
